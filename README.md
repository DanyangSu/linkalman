* ~~Finalize Model design~~
* ~~Draft V0~~
* ~~Derive the math for the whole system~~
* ~~Finish Draft 1~~
* ~~Finish Draft 1 of theory.tex with variable system matrices~~
* ~~Figure out sequential Update of diagonal R~~
* ~~LDL decomposition of non-diagonal R~~
* ~~Implementation Design~~
* ~~Rewrite derivation of smoother and filter with sequential update~~
* ~~Add EM section~~
* ~~Create M read mode, and get it work~~
* ~~Finish delta2 and chi2~~
* ~~Read other package codes and figure out where to add Cholesky transform and reverse~~
* ~~Derive the complete delta2 and chi2~~
* ~~Masked values~~
* ~~Rethink the structure of filter and smoother~~
* ~~Modify smoother section. Add xi2 and xi_t_xi_1t_T~~
* ~~Finish EM~~
* ~~Rewrite things in array form~~
* ~~Finish filter and smoother~~
* ~~Clean up equations numbers etc~~
* ~~Finish simple model~~
* ~~Finish complex ts model~~
* ~~produce projections~~
* ~~Rename simple_EM to constantEM~~
* Test base
* ~~Make it a package~~
* Test utils
